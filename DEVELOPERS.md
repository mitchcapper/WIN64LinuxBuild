# Key Goals
- We try to avoid modifying the users system or msys install.  We try to make sure everything we download/use is stored under the WLB_BASE_FOLDER for easy cleanup (or alternate bases).  Sometimes we will use a users tools (ie cmake binary) but shouldn't require them.
- Builds follow a standardized format even if the app itself doesn't.  Sometimes this results in us having to manually move files around to match the final folder structure.
- For new builds use the build script generator [BuildScriptGenerator.csx](build/BuildScriptGenerator.csx) to generate the initial build template.  See the build [README](build/README.md) for details on its use.

# Helpers in Detail
The helpers are where the bulk of code is consolidated down that we would use for repeatedly.  They are broken down into the following

- helpers.sh - The main helper file any utility functions not found in the others, also something of the main on run handler
- helpers_gnu.sh - Mostly gnulib related tools for adding our additional modules, making sure our wrapper scripts are used, removing test/doc/po features if flagged to do so to speed up runs
- helpers_cmake.sh - By default most things are built around standard make, for cmake builds this has all the helper functions and wrappers.  We go to decent length to support a variety of cmake build engines (see BLD_CONFIG_CMAKE_STYLE) by default.  
- helpers_bashtrace.sh - Provide meaingful stacktraces on failure, ability to log all the shell commands we execute (output stored in - `buildname-cmd.log`), ability to filter certain items out of the trace as well.
- helpers_git.sh - handle cloning, custom git options, some staging features so it is easier to track automatic code changes (these get staged) vs manual code edits you may make (so you can easily see those and make them back to the original lib).  Git settings are all stored in ENV vars to avoid screwing up any actual git configs.
- helpers_vcpkg.sh - handles installing and removing vcpkg packages, adding them to the proper path/env/includes even installs vcpkg is not installed (we use a local copy separate from the system to avoid polluting the users vcpkg.
- helpers_ini.sh - INI reader and config merge/templating tool.  It also handles exporting the final config to a file so it can be consumed by other things (ie our visual studio sln generator).


# debugging build failures

- Setting the env var `BLD_CONFIG_BUILD_DEBUG` to 1 will not only build with debug symbols but also will make the build scripts themselves more verbose.   

in the base working dir we generate several useful files including:
- `buildname-cmd.log` - Nearly all the shell commands our helper scripts execute on a given run
- `buildname-configure.log` - the output of the configure command
- `buildname-env.log` - The enviromental variables set when configure was run

The build scripts support resuming.  Most support several default steps (run the buildscript with --help to see the list of those).  IE `./f_buildname_build.sh bootstrap` will start at the bootstrapping step.  Some build scripts make have custom steps in them you can see by opening them.
It is not recommended to run most commands manually but rather try to use the resuming of the build script.  There can often be environmental variables set in the script that if not set when the command is run manually will change the outcome. 

# patch generation
Easy way to generate the patch from modified repo, go to your modified branch (make sure code committed) and run: git diff --color=never master > repo_NAME.patch

You will want to preserve whitespace when generating the patch but we will ignore whne applying.
